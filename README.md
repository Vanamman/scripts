livestreamer.py

This is just a simple script that asks the user for a twitch.tv channel name and the quality they want to use. It uses that input to run livestreamer and open that stream it in the default player.


mpv.py

This is a small script that allows you to play a youtube video with the video player mpv. It will automatically play the video with the best video and audio format possible. 

ytld.py

A simple script using youtube-dl to download videos. Not much better than just using the terminal honestly. Still working on other options for it.
